This repository contains Diego Ongaro's PhD dissertation, *Consensus: Bridging
Theory and Practice*, published by Stanford University in 2014. The
dissertation PDFs and the dissertation sources are licensed under the Creative
Commons Attribution license, as described in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.


The source materials for the dissertation are made available here in the hopes
that they might be useful, for example, to reformat the dissertation for a
different medium or to copy sections for use in other documents (per the
[LICENSE](LICENSE)). It requires the following to build:

 - GNU make
 - pdflatex
 - bibtex
 - Inkscape (to convert SVG images and layers from SVG images to PDF format)


Several pre-built PDFs are also included:

 - [book.pdf](book.pdf): formatted for a printed book
   (8.5x11" pages, bigger inside margins for binding, black hyperlinks)
 - [online.pdf](online.pdf): formatted for normal digital or print use
   (8.5x11" pages, consistent margins on all pages, blue hyperlinks)
 - [online-trim.pdf](online-trim.pdf): formatted for digital viewing
   (6.6x9.35" pages, minimal margins, blue hyperlinks)
 - [stanford.pdf](stanford.pdf): exact file distributed by Stanford University
   (similar to `online.pdf`; copyright, signature, and preface pages differ)

All of these use the same page numbers starting at page 1, though `book.pdf` has
an additional blank page before the introduction (page xviii).
