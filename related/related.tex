\label{related}

This chapter discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Raft in the context
of related work. Section~\ref{related:overview} first gives a brief
introduction to other consensus algorithms and compares them to Raft at
a high level. Then,
Sections~\ref{related:leaderelection}--\ref{related:correctness} focus
on more specific details of how these consensus algorithms compare to
Raft. Finally, Section~\ref{related:understandability} discusses work
related to evaluating understandability.
